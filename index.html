      <h1>Australia’s Ageing and Public Hospital Capacity (2001–2025)</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        This page assesses whether the public hospital system has expanded in line with the rapid growth of Australia’s older population.
        The analysis integrates demographic indicators with measures of hospital availability and presents a clear narrative across space and time.

      <h2 id="why">Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The share of Australians aged 65 years and over has increased steadily over the past two decades. Older populations typically require more frequent and complex care.
        Evaluating whether hospital capacity has grown commensurately is essential for planning, equity, and fiscal sustainability.

          Colour encodes the percentage of residents aged 65+. Circle size represents either the number of public hospitals or hospitals per 100,000 residents (toggle in the chart).

        <div><strong>What this shows</strong> Older age structures are concentrated in southern and coastal jurisdictions—most notably Tasmania and South Australia.</div>
        <div><strong>Why it matters</strong> Concentrated ageing implies uneven pressure on local systems, including higher inpatient demand, longer travel times, and potential pressure on sub-acute services.</div>
        <div><strong>So what</strong> Capacity planning should be spatially differentiated: jurisdictions with older age profiles likely require proportionately more beds and workforce.</div>

        <div><strong>What this shows</strong> The older-age share rises consistently across the period, whereas measured capacity grows more slowly.</div>
        <div><strong>Why it matters</strong> A widening separation between need and capacity signals increasing pressure on throughput, waiting lists, and staffing.</div>
        <div><strong>So what</strong> Without targeted expansion and productivity gains, demographic momentum is likely to outstrip available resources.</div>

        <div><strong>Key finding</strong> Several jurisdictions fall below the national benchmark, indicating relatively limited availability for older residents.</div>
        <div><strong>Why it matters</strong> Below-benchmark availability suggests higher risk of service constraint as the cohort continues to grow.</div>

      <div class="grid">
        <p>
          Across space and time, population ageing has outpaced the expansion of public hospital capacity. While some jurisdictions are comparatively well positioned, others remain below national benchmarks. The evidence supports targeted investments in facilities, workforce, and models of care that reflect local demography and geography, alongside productivity improvements to ease pressure on waiting lists and budgets.
        </p>
        <p class="meta">
          Limitations: indicators measure availability rather than utilisation or outcomes; smaller jurisdictions may exhibit volatility; private provision and cross-border flows are outside scope.
