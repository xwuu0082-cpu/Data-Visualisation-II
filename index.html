    <h1>Australia’s Ageing & Hospital Capacity</h1>
    <p class="lead">From 2001–2025, are public hospitals keeping pace with an ageing population across Australia?</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>Australia’s share of residents aged 65+ continues to rise, reshaping the demand for healthcare services. 
      This page combines demographic and health infrastructure data to reveal where ageing is concentrated, 
      how hospital capacity has changed, and whether availability matches need.</p>

      <div class="chart-title">Where is ageing most concentrated?</div>
      <div class="chart-subtitle">Spatial overview by state</div>
      <p>Older populations are concentrated in southern and coastal states such as Tasmania and South Australia. 
      These areas likely face greater demand for hospital services as ageing accelerates.</p>

      <div class="chart-subtitle">National trend, 2001–2025</div>
      <p>Over time, Australia’s elderly share rose steadily while hospital capacity expanded more slowly. 
      The widening gap between the two lines highlights growing pressure on healthcare systems.</p>

      <p>Hospital availability differs widely across states. Those above the national line have relatively better access, 
      while states below may struggle to provide sufficient care as ageing intensifies.</p>

      <div class="chart-title">Does higher ageing imply better availability?</div>
      <div class="chart-subtitle">State comparison in 2025</div>
      <p>If hospital planning kept pace with ageing, we’d expect a clear upward trend. 
      Instead, states with higher elderly shares often appear below the trend, 
      suggesting relatively fewer hospitals per elderly resident.</p>

      <p>The heatmap shows how availability changed across time and states. 
      Darker rows signal improvement; lighter areas indicate persistent shortages. 
      Progress remains uneven, revealing regional disparities in healthcare capacity.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Across space and time, ageing has outpaced hospital growth. 
      While some states improved their capacity, others lag behind. 
      The evidence suggests Australia must invest strategically in hospital infrastructure 
      to ensure equitable care for an ageing nation.</p>
